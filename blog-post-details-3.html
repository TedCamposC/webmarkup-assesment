            The cyclical nature of this transfer will please the football romantics; Walcott has returned to the club
            where it all began and where he burst onto the scene aged just 16.

            However, having never hit the dizzy heights many predicted at Arsenal, and with his spell at Everton largely
            unsuccessful, is his career a tale of unfulfilled potential?

            Fourteen years after leaving the south coast to head to north London for a fee of £5m plus add-ons, Theo
            Walcott has returned to his boyhood club. '

            He returns having forged a decent Premier League career but having not hit the levels many had anticipated
            for Walcott when he left as a 17-year-old.

            Walcott broke through very early at Southampton and became their youngest ever first-team player when he
            came off the bench in a 0-0 draw at home to Wolves in the Championship at just 16 years and 143 days.

            Walcott would also become Southampton’s youngest ever goal scorer, scoring in a 2-1 defeat to Wolves in his
            full debut before scoring in the following two matches.

            Premier League clubs were very much aware of the young speedster’s potential and had already begun circling.
